Description
===========

QuickSetDNS is a simple tool that allows you to easily change the DNS
servers that are used for your Internet connection. You can set the
desired DNS servers from the user interface, by choosing from a list of
DNS servers that you defined, or from command-line, without displaying
any user interface.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000
and up to Windows 8. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.02:
  o Added 'Always On Top' option.

* Version 1.01:
  o Added 'Router DNS' item, which allows you to choose the internal
    DNS server of your router.

* Version 1.00 - First release.



Start Using QuickSetDNS
=======================

QuickSetDNS doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
QuickSetDNS.exe

After running QuickSetDNS, the main window allows you to easily choose
the desired DNS servers to use on your Internet connection, by using the
'Set Active DNS' option (F2). By default, QuickSetDNS provides only one
alternative: the public DNS servers of Google - 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
You can easily add more DNS servers to the list by using the 'New DNS
Server' option (Ctrl+N).

If the 'Automatic DNS' option is selected, then the DNS server
information is received from your router automatically, using DHCP.

If you have multiple network adapters, you may need to choose the correct
network adapter from the combo-box located just below the toolbar of
QuickSetDNS.



Setting DNS servers from command-line
=====================================

With QuickSetDNS, you can easily set the desired DNS servers from
command-line, without displaying any user intertface by using the /SetDNS
command:

QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS [DNS Servers List] [Network Adapter String]

[DNS Servers List] specifies the DNS servers, delimited by comma if there
are multiple servers. If empty string is specified ( "" ), QuickSetDNS
will set the automatic DNS mode.
[Network Adapter String] specifies the unique ID string of your network
adapter. If you don't know what is your Network Adapter String, simply
press Ctrl+L (Copy SetDNS Command-Line) and the entire command needed to
set the selected DNS server will be copied to the clipboard.
If empty string is specified ( "" ), QuickSetDNS will try to choose the
correct network adapter automatically.

Here's some examples for the /SetDNS command:
QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4"
"{F41A4233-02DA-42D6-A97B-A2D12F9FE0CD}"
QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4"
QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS "" "{F41A4233-02DA-42D6-A97B-A2D12F9FE0CD}"
QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS ""
QuickSetDNS.exe /SetDNS "192.168.1.1"
"{F41A4233-02DA-42D6-A97B-A2D12F9FE0CD}"




Translating QuickSetDNS to other languages
==========================================

In order to translate QuickSetDNS to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run QuickSetDNS with /savelangfile parameter:
   QuickSetDNS.exe /savelangfile
   A file named QuickSetDNS_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   QuickSetDNS utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run QuickSetDNS, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run QuickSetDNS without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
